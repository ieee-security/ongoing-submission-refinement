# Original Proposal for Journal-Style Submission Model


Inspired by the VLDB transition to a journal-style submission model, the organizers of the IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium 2017 and 2018 proposed a new model for submissions to the flagship security conference. The original proposal for revising the submission model had several goals for improving the reviewing process in the security community:

  - Improve quality of submitted papers.

  The frequent submission opportunities introduced by the new model provide a clear advantage to the authors and the community in general. This allows fast dissemination of new research results to the public domain, and a more streamlined process for paper acceptance and publication. In the new model, authors can avoid submitting half-baked results, and instead choose to submit their papers when they are ready, while working under less time pressure.


  - Improve quality of the review process.

  With fixed conference deadlines, PC members are loaded in a short time period (1.5 to 2 months) with a large number of papers (typically between 20 and 25 papers). The revised submission model was intended to smooth the reviewing workload to a low-volume, ongoing effort. That way, PC members would have a manageable workload of several papers every month or two and would have more time to provide more detailed feedback to the authors.

  The fast turnaround time from submission to author notification (two months) was intended to provide quick feedback to the authors, useful for improving their work.

  The new submission model introduced a new option of “Revision”, in which authors receive a list of conditions and can resubmit the paper within three months.  This facilitates a more collaborative process between reviewers and authors, with the ultimate goal of improving paper quality and the review process.
