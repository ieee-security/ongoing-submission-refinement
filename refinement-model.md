# Refining the IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium Reviewing Model


We thus propose several slight adjustments to the reviewing process for IEEE S&P to address the aforementioned challenges.

1. We believe that the community benefits greatly from a flexible submission model and we would like to keep multiple deadlines per year. We propose a change from monthly to quarterly submission deadlines.  The goal will be to choose deadlines that, to the extent possible, complement (rather than overlap) those of other major security conferences.  Ideally, we will work with those conferences to ensure that, taken as a whole, security researchers always have at least one deadline to choose from within any given month.


  - The advantage of quarterly submissions is that the reviewing cycles do not overlap and the entire PC can participate in all reviewing cycles, avoiding PC fragmentation. The reviewing process will thus become more consistent from cycle to cycle and expertise will be easier to allocate.


  - The proposal for 2021 is to have the following deadlines: March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1.


2. We propose to increase the time between submission and notification to allow for a second round of reviews, when necessary. We would like to send early reject notifications in a two-month timeframe, but we will use an additional three weeks for a second round of review for papers that are either controversial or need additional expertise. We will seek external experts outside the PC when expertise on the PC is not available. Thus, we propose the following timeline:


3. The Revision process has received positive feedback from the community. We plan to keep the Revised option without major modifications. Each Revised paper is assigned a point of contact in the Program Committee to facilitate the interaction between authors and reviewers. Authors can submit a Revised paper to the next two quarterly submission deadlines after the notification.


4. All papers accepted by February 21 in a year will appear in the proceedings of that year. These include papers that were submitted on December 1 and were accepted, or papers that were submitted by June 1, got the Revise decision, and resubmitted the Revision on December 1.

5. Rejected papers must wait for one year, from the date of the original submission, to resubmit to the IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium.

6. We will keep the online PC meeting on a quarterly basis. The online PC meeting is an effective way for PC members to discuss papers and make decisions together, as well as calibrate between different areas. The meeting will be held approximately one week  before the final notification. We will try to organize one of the PC meetings in person at the IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium or other major security conference.

7. We will introduce the Associate Chairs who will assist in assigning reviewers to papers in their area and ensuring that the review process is fair. Associate chairs are members of the community with broad expertise in security. Each Associate Chair will be responsible for a subset of submitted papers, as assigned by the Program Committee co-chairs. Associate Chairs will participate in the online discussion for the papers they are responsible for and are required to attend the online and in-person PC meetings.
