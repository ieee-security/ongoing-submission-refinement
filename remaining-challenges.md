# Remaining Challenges


The new reviewing model created some new challenges, motivating us to think about making slight adjustments starting with 2021.

1. We observed that while some PC members appreciate low-level, on-going reviewing (e.g., 6 review cycles in 2019), others find that it wears them out.  They find it difficult to allocate time to review papers on an ongoing basis, particularly as other conferences moved to multiple deadlines per year and reviewing periods overlap.

2. In 2020, to address the issue above, we reduced the reviewing cycles each PC member participates in to 3 cycles per year. We found out that this decision increased PC fragmentation and exacerbated the problem of finding expertise in areas with very few experts in the community.

3. The fast turnaround time between submission and notification precludes a formal, second round of reviews. We observed that in some cases papers do not get sufficient expertise in a single round of review, which then leaves the PC chairs little time to solicit an additional expert opinion.
