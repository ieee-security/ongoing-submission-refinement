# Refining the IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium Submission Model

This GitHub repository aims to be a public forum for the crafting, documenting, and detailed planning of the refinement of the submission model for IEEE Security &amp; Privacy (a.k.a. Oakland).  We plan to adopt the new model for the Oakland 2021 conference.

This repository can be used as with any other OSS code repository; i.e, you can fork, edit, and submit pull requests as you wish, to change the text of the proposed plan.

However, we encourage the use of the GitHub *issues* feature to allow for threaded discussion of proposed changes.  As a general rule, changes to the mainline draft plan without a corresponding discussion in the issues won't be accepted.  Discussions within a pull request will be focused on minor tweaks and improvements.

The original submission plan for a journal-style submission for Oakland (defined in 2017) is available at https://ieee-security.github.io/ongoing-submission-plan/.

## Proposed plan for the refinement of the submission model:
* **[Original Proposal](original-proposal.md)**
* **[Observed Advantages](observed-advantages.md)**
* **[Remaining Challenges](remaining-challenges.md)**
* **[Refinement to the Submission Model](refinement-model.md)**
